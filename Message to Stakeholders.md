**Subject: Summary of Data Analysis and Key Insights**

Hi [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I've completed the data analysis and would like to share some key findings and data quality concerns:

1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - **Products Table:** Out of 845,552 product entries, 4,025 have missing barcodes. Additionally, we've identified duplicate barcodes for distinctly different brands (017000329260 for SCHWARZKOPF and 052336919068 for GÖT2B), suggesting issues with barcode uniqueness.
   - **Transactions Table:** There appears to be a mutual exclusivity between the `FINAL_QUANTITY` and `FINAL_SALE` columns—when one has a value, the other is null. This inconsistency needs clarification to understand the data's intent and improve reliability.

2. **Trend Analysis**
   - **Power Users Identification:** Using total order revenue, number of orders, and last purchase date, we focused on the top 20% of users. Our analysis indicates that Millennials (1981-1996), followed by Generation X (1965-1980) and Baby Boomers (1946-1964), are the primary power users, notably active in purchasing health and wellness products. Notably, CVS stands out as the leading brand among long-term users.

3. **Outstanding Issues and Actions Needed**
   - **Barcode Integrity:** To address missing and duplicate barcodes, I recommend a review of our product entry processes to ensure accuracy and uniqueness.
   - **Demographic Insights:** Additional demographic data collection for users could help refine our understanding of purchasing patterns and enhance targeted marketing strategies.

I believe addressing these issues will greatly improve our data integrity and analytical capabilities. Could we discuss these findings and the way forward? I look forward to your thoughts and any additional insights you might have.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.

Best,  
Chen
